I am by no means solving these problems impressively or effectivly, but I hope that I at least get better for each day by challenging myself.

Often I get a bit stuck solving the problems, so therefore I resolve to the internet to get some help. I would particularly like to give a shoutout to these guys as I find their solutions quite inspiring and I often go so far as nearly stealing some parts of their answers.
